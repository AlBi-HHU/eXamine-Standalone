eXamine
=======

This stand-alone version of eXamine derives from the [Cytoscape app eXamine](https://github.com/ls-cwi/eXamine).
It supports a set-oriented visual analysis approach for annotated network modules.
These network modules are displayed as node-link diagrams with colored contours
on top to depict sets of nodes that share an annotation.
